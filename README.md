# seafile-scraper

This scraper is implemented to facilitate my mini job as a tutor (Corrector). This script gets an assignment number as input and 
downloads all corresponding assignments. Running the shell script won't make sense for any reader as one needs to have 
credentials in my university and also be assigned as tutor to receive the bag of assignments to correct.
